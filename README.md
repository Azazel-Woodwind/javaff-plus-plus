# JavaFF2.1
An implementation of the FF forward search planning system in Java. JavaFF 2.1 is itself a branch of JavaFF planner by Andrew Coles, to allow parsing and solving of PDDL 2.1 problems. Additional improvements include optimisation to enable order-of-magnitude speedups over vanilla JavaFF. This is most likely version 2.1.8, which supports STRIPS and ADL planning, but not metrics and temporal aspects. The code to do this exists within JavaFF but has been disabled (somewhere) as it was unnecessary and introduced additional complexity.
