miconic hard - parallel very clear winner, only EHC, also better costs
tsp hard - serial wins as very easy, only EHC, same costs
logistics hard - both never ground
gripper medium - ehc always fails, only bfs, parallel still better
hanoi - some easy quickly solve but rest ehc instantly fails and bfs stays stuck at same heuristic
blocks - instantly grounds, ehc instantly fails, bfs forever, takes too long to calculate heuristic
mystery medium - EHC cannot find solution - goes very deep and cant find better heuristic

ehc doesnt always fail the same problem
grounding and reachability bottleneck
